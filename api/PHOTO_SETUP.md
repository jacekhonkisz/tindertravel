# 🖼️ Hotel Photo Integration Setup

## Overview

Your TinderTravel app now uses **Hotellook API** for real hotel photos instead of placeholder images! This provides authentic, high-quality photos from actual hotels.

## ✅ What's Working Now

- ✅ **City Lookup**: Successfully finding cities (Rome, Lisbon, Santorini, etc.)
- ✅ **API Integration**: Hotellook client fully integrated
- ✅ **Fallback System**: Automatic fallback to curated photos if API fails
- ✅ **Caching**: 1-hour cache for better performance

## 🔧 Setup Required

To get **real hotel photos**, you need Hotellook API credentials:

### 1. Get Hotellook API Access

1. Visit: https://support.travelpayouts.com/hc/en-us/articles/203956133-Hotel-Search-API
2. Sign up for a Travelpayouts account
3. Get your API credentials:
   - `HOTELLOOK_TOKEN` - Your API token
   - `HOTELLOOK_MARKER` - Your affiliate marker ID

### 2. Add to Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Hotellook API Configuration
HOTELLOOK_TOKEN=your_hotellook_token_here
HOTELLOOK_MARKER=your_marker_id_here
```

## 📸 How It Works

### Current Flow:
1. **Amadeus API** → Hotel data (name, location, pricing)
2. **Hotellook API** → Real hotel photos (6 photos per city)
3. **Fallback** → Curated Unsplash photos if Hotellook fails

### Photo Selection Logic:
- Finds hotels with most photos in each city
- Selects top 6 photos from highest-rated hotels
- Automatically caches results for 1 hour
- Falls back to beautiful placeholder photos if needed

## 🧪 Testing

Test the integration:

```bash
node test-hotellook.js
```

**Current Results** (without credentials):
- ✅ City lookup works perfectly
- ⚠️ Photo fetching needs API credentials
- ✅ Fallback system working

**With Credentials** (expected):
- ✅ Real hotel photos from Rome, Lisbon, Santorini, etc.
- ✅ 6 high-quality photos per destination
- ✅ Automatic caching and error handling

## 🎯 Benefits

### Before (Amadeus only):
- ❌ No photos available
- 📷 Static placeholder images
- 😞 Poor user experience

### After (Amadeus + Hotellook):
- ✅ Real hotel photos
- 📸 6 photos per destination
- 🚀 Better user engagement
- 💾 Smart caching
- 🛡️ Reliable fallback system

## 🔄 Integration Status

- ✅ **Hotellook Client**: Created and integrated
- ✅ **Amadeus Client**: Updated to use Hotellook photos
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback system
- ✅ **Caching**: Optimized for performance
- ✅ **Testing**: Basic functionality verified

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Get API Credentials**: Sign up for Hotellook API
2. **Add Environment Variables**: Configure your `.env` file
3. **Test Full Integration**: Run tests with real credentials
4. **Deploy**: Your app will now show real hotel photos!
